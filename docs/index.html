<h2> An IOT Stack for an Internet of Things of Yours </h2>

<P>IOT-KIT is a toolkit for adding connectivity to devices in a standardised
manner so that they can be discovered, queries, controlled and
internetworked.  The primary purpose of this domain is to provide a link

<P> The protocol it speaks is called "iotoy" - which stands for
    "Internet Of Things Of Yours"
