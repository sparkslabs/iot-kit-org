<h1> iotoy.org/types/str </h1><P> Note that the constraints specification is not fully decided yet, and as such should be interpreted as a person not as a machine. This will hopefully be tightened up
<P>Please note, if you use a client that does not say "Accept: text/html" or 
similar, then you will get a response of application/json - suitable for
machine parsing.
